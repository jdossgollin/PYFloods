# PYFloods

Welcome!
If you are reaching this page, you are probably looking for the codes used to generate the analysis in the paper [ Heavy Rainfall in Paraguay during the 2015/16 Austral Summer: Causes and Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Predictive Skill](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0805.1).
The repository contining this analysis is still freely available but has been renamed [2018-paraguay-floods](https://github.com/jdossgollin/2018-paraguay-floods).
Sorry for the inconvenience!
